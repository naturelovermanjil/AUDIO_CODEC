This VHDL code creates an audio controller that uses a clocked protocol (like I2S) to send stereo audio data serially. It produces clocks, uses a state machine to switch between left and right channels, and delivers the audio data as a serial bitstream.

Hardware :
FPGA board - Xilinx 
Clock source and audio interface (e.g., DA7212 DAC).
Software :
VHDL design tools: Xilinx Vivado 
Simulation tools: ModelSim
