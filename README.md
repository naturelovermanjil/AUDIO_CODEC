# 4-Bit Adder in VHDL   

implementation of a **4-bit adder** in VHDL. The design includes a carry-in (`Cin`) and carry-out (`Cout`) signal and can perform addition of two 4-bit binary numbers.

---

## Features

- Adds two 4-bit binary numbers (`A` and `B`).
- Supports a carry-in (`Cin`) input.
- Outputs a 4-bit sum (`Sum`) and a carry-out (`Cout`).
